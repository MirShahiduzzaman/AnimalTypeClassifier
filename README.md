# PokemonTypeClassifier
  As a Pokemon research team, we looked into the most ethical way to classify the type of Pokemon based on its stats. We first split the dataset into 6 datasets, each with their own attributes. We then removed unhelpful data in determining the type and selected the best K value for our models. 
  
  The next step was for us to run the models. The first model was Naive Bayes, for which we used Guassian, Bernoulli, and Multinomial. We found Guassian to be least effective compared to the other classifiers in the Naive Bayes. The Bernoulli Chi-Squaredâ€™s highest accuracy was 52%. The Multinomial provided the second highest accuracy with the Chi Square feature selection yielding an accuracy of 51%. We also used a decision tree. After optimizing and trimming, we learned the most accurate tree was the gini tree, with an accuracy of 47%. As for the K Nearest Neighbor, it provided the least accurate results, mainly due to the datasets having a high number of data points. 
  
  While completing the ensemble, we were able to increase the accuracy for each, but only by 0.01 for Multinomial, 0.04 for the decision tree, and 0.02 for the decision tree using the random forest classifier. As a result, we concluded that we cannot classify pokemon solely based on its stats, but we hypothesized that it would be possible given more data, such as color and appearance.
